        <p><span>Saskatoon Public Schools</span> use the Edsby communication platform to provide parents and caregivers with the opportunity to follow their child's progress at school, receive school updates and much more. For each of your children — even if they go to different schools — you'll see their classes, teachers and school information. Parents and caregivers may contact their child's school​​ about parent accounts.​</p>

However, if you would like to override the default language used by Edsby, you can do so within Edsby in Account Settings > Preferences > Preferred Language.
